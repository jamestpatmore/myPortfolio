    <h1> Intro</h1>
    <p>My Journey started only 6 months ago...I was aimlessly going through life, working very hard but for what.
        I had no vision, and that's when I sat down with myself and really thought about who I wanted myself to be a couple years from now.
        I have always looked at myself as someone with intellect and the yearn for creating beautiful fabrications. I love music, I love technology,
        I love my dear Pokemon cards, and I love Design. When I put all of these together I thought what would be a field that could cater my curosities in life.  
    </p>
    </br>
    <p> I thought why not coding, the abstract nature of it. As well as the ability to create whatever turned the lightbulb on in my head. This was one of the best decisions I could ever make in my life and I didn't even know it yet!
    </p>
    </br>
    <p> So I enrolled myself in University of Arizona's Bootcamp program. I was a college dropout that had already went to the Univeristy for Logisitcs and Supply Chain and I needed a way to learn this process on an expedited program. 
        I saw some pundits claim that it is a difficult road taking this route given the timeframe. But I am an obessive natured individual, and when I truly love something,
        I consume my life around that concept.
    </p>
    </br>
    <h1>The Beginning to the Everlong Journey</h1>
    <p>I emmersed myself with HTML/CSS projects before class even started and I was already starting to love the creative touch that web development requires and yearns.
        I was infatuated. Nothing has made me feel this way since I was in early grade school.
    </p>
    </br>
    <p>I then started working with Javascript and that made all of my aspirations come to life, I finally had the key to doors that I previously didn't have and thats when I truly knew I am doing what I love.</p>
    </br>
    <p>It doesn't stop there...as time went by I grew mass amounts of knowledge day by day. In these past 6 months I have atleast put 30 hours a week into polishing my development prowess. 
        I have learned to this point Javascript, React, Python, HTML/CSS, Node.js, express, mySQL, MongoDB, handlebars.js(MVC), sequelize, Bootstrap/Bulma, etc.. 
    </p>
    </br>
    <p> Now with these tools in my arsenal and the abilty to construct dynamic websites/applications I feel like I can create almost anything</p>
    </br>
    <h1>Outro</h1>
    <p>Look I know there are many canidates novice to experienced. With me however, you are getting someone with an immense amount of potential, knowledge
    and the drive to learn anything and everything within the totality of devolpement. With all the curriculum that this world provides, you just can't teach that.
